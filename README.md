This is my first Telegram bot that repeats the message that you sent. 
It just shows the sample of simple Telegram bot with webhook implementation that receives message with text or emoji and sends the same message to you back.

If you want to try it yourself, clone this repository to your GitHub, change BotId and Heroku application link in configuration file and deploy it on Heroku.

How to deploy an application from GitHub to Heroku server please read in the documentation of Heroku.
